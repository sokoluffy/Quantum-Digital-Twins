# Quantum-Digital-Twins

This is a code for generating quantum databse (or quantum digital twins) by extracting quantum machine data from IBM quantum computers (open access) and deploying your quantum circuit models on quantum digital twins. There are several advantages:
1. It is local and fast for benchmarking noisy quantum computers.
2. It is versioned based on timestamp. Hence, you know your data values. IBM calibration wont affect your quantum data. 
3. It is real quantum device database.
4. It works even if the IBM server is down.
5. There is no waiting time in queue in IBM servers.
6. It is easier to investigate error mitigation techniques than on the quantum server.
7. It is eaier to analyze the impact of noisy quantum computers on your use cases.
   
To use use this code, you can install the python environment: conda env create -f environment.yml (see https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)
