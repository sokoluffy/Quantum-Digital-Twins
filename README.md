# Quantum-Digital-Twins

This is a code for generating quantum databse by extracting quantum machines data from IBM quantum computers (open access). There are several advantages:
1. It is local and fast for benchmarking noisy quantum computers.
2. It is real quantum device database.
3. It works even if the IBM server is down.
4. There is no waiting time in queue in IBM servers.
5. It is easier to investigate error mitigation techniques than on the quantum server.
6. It is eaier to analyze the impact of noisy quantum computers on your use cases.
   
If you use this code in your research or your study then we would appreciate in citing some of our works:
